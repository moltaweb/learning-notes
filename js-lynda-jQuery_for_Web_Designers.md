## jQuery Introduction

### jQuery is a JavaScript library

jQuery is a collection of functions that add onto JavaScript. Its main purpose is to select DOM elements.

jQuery is a shortening for JavaScript Query (querying the DOM).

What we do with jQuery we can also do it without it, just with plain JS. But jQuery makes it a lot easier, while also providingin compatibility among browsers.

### When to user jQuery

Reasons to use it:
* When our Framework/CMS has it installed (WordPRess does)
* When we want to use a jQuery plugin
* To support older browsers
* Do more with less JS

When not to use it:
* When we need ultra high JS performance
* When we only need to use a tiny piece of jQuery

### Alternatives to jQuery

If we only need a few functions from jQuery, we might want to check these out:

* Chibi
* Zepto.js
* Mootools
* Sencha Ext JS
* MicroJS.com

### Which version to use

If we have jQuery on our project we can check the version by going to the console and typing `jQuery.fn.jQuery`

If we want a fresh installation, the best version is the latest available in jQuery.com, unless we need to support older browsers, in which case we can download an older version

Also, there is a lighter version called Slim, without AJAX and all the animation stuff
